- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By giving priority to the critical tasks first, you can ensure that your project stays on track and meets its deadlines. Use task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, to help keep track of your tasks and prioritize them accordingly. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial for any project. When starting a new project or undertaking a large task, take the time to plan out your approach and break it down into smaller, manageable steps. Creating a detailed plan will ensure you have a clear understanding of what needs to happen and when, allowing you and your team to stay on target and avoid potential bottlenecks.  
3. Stay organized: As a programmer, maintaining a clean and organized codebase is vital for efficiency and ease of maintenance. Follow best practices, like using version control systems (like Git), organizing your code into logical folders and files, following coding conventions, commenting your codes, etc. These practices will not only help in maintaining your work but also in collaborating with others.

- "Programming wisdom for today: Always write code as if the person who will maintain it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live." 

This quote, often attributed to Martin Golding, emphasizes the importance of writing clean, understandable, and well-documented code. It's not only about making your own life easier when you have to revisit your code in the future but also about showing respect for your colleagues who may have to work with your code. Writing code that is difficult to understand or modify can lead to frustration and mistakes, so always strive to make your code as clear and concise as possible.

- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize your time and focus on the most important tasks. This means breaking down your project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritizing them based on their impact on your overall goal. By doing this, you can ensure that you are making progress towards your goal and not getting lost in trivial tasks that don't contribute to the bigger picture.

Another piece of wisdom to keep in mind is the importance of communication and collaboration with your team. Programming can be a solitary task, but often, the best solutions come from open discussion and sharing ideas. Make sure to reach out to your colleagues and discuss potential solutions, even if you think you have a great idea. They may have something even better to contribute.
