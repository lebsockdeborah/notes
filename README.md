- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By giving priority to the critical tasks first, you can ensure that your project stays on track and meets its deadlines. Use task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, to help keep track of your tasks and prioritize them accordingly. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial for any project. When starting a new project or undertaking a large task, take the time to plan out your approach and break it down into smaller, manageable steps. Creating a detailed plan will ensure you have a clear understanding of what needs to happen and when, allowing you and your team to stay on target and avoid potential bottlenecks.  
3. Stay organized: As a programmer, maintaining a clean and organized codebase is vital for efficiency and ease of maintenance. Follow best practices, like using version control systems (like Git), organizing your code into logical folders and files, following coding conventions, commenting your codes, etc. These practices will not only help in maintaining your work but also in collaborating with others.
